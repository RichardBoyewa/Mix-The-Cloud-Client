 <h2>Genesis</h2>
 <p>I've always been involved in djing and electronic music in general. </p>
 <p>The Idea of building **Mix the cloud** has been sitting at the back of my mind for at least six or seven years.</p>
 <p>I was in my early twenties when house parties started being increasingly frequent in my week-end routine; but in a situation where you don't have your own music with you, having to switch from a browser window to another can get annoying. I thought I would have liked to build something that could solve my issue, but I didn't have skills at the time, so I just kept daydreaming on it for a while, until I took the WDI course at GA, which gave me the skills I needed.</p>
 <p>**Mix the cloud** has been my capstone project for the course, and even though there's still a lot to do, I think is a reasonably good and fun product, having spent hours playing with it myself. </p>
<p> Keep reading this readme for a more detailed breakdown of the development process.</p>
  
 <h2>Planning</h2>
 <p>Having chosen the topic for my project, I then started the planning bit. I therefore decided what I had to do first, in order to get a decent product to build on.</p>
<p>After setting up the environment for the app, I built the API for the back-end, which is build on **Ruby on Rails**. Because of the fact that I did not need a complex structure for it, once I got the users' authentication working, I started moving onto the front-end, for which I've used AngularJS, and defined a basic MVP, which can be summarised as follows:  </p>
<ul> 
<li>Find out how to search for tracks in the SoundCloud API.</li>
<li>Find out how to stream those tracks the search has produced as results.</li>
<li>Find a way to change the playback speed of a track while is played. </li>
<li>Create a crossfader that could fade the volume in and out between two different players that are playing simultanously.</li>
<li>Add sound effects.</li>
<li>Design a logo.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Those who have spent sometime djing will know that these are pretty much the essential functionalities in a dj console (not the logo, of course, that's just a plus), so I decided I'd have started from these points, and I have used trello to divide my tasks day by day.</p>
